## Task
In this Kata, you will be given a string of numbers in sequence and your task
will be to return the missing number. If there is no number missing or there
is an error in the sequence, return -1.

For example:
```
missing("123567") = 4 
missing("899091939495") = 92
missing("9899101102") = 100
missing("599600601602") = -1 -- no number missing
missing("8990919395") = -1 -- error in sequence. Both 92 and 94 missing.
```

The sequence will always be in ascending order.

More examples in the test cases.

Good luck!
