Multiplication Tables
=

## Task
Create a function that accepts dimensions, of Rows x Columns, as parameters in order to create a multiplication table sized according to the given dimensions. **The return value of the function must be an array, and the numbers must be Fixnums, NOT strings.

Example:

```
multiplication_table(3,3)

1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
```

-->[[1,2,3],[2,4,6],[3,6,9]]

Each value on the table should be equal to the value of multiplying the number in its first row times the number in its first column.
