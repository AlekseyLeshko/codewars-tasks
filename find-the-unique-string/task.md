## Task
There is an array of strings. All strings contains similar letters except one. Try to find it!

```
findUniq([ 'Aa', 'aaa', 'aaaaa', 'BbBb', 'Aaaa', 'AaAaAa', 'a' ]) === 'BbBb'
findUniq([ 'abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'foo', 'bca', 'cab', 'cba' ]) === 'foo'
```

Strings may contain spaces. Spaces is not significant, only non-spaces symbols matters. E.g. string that contains only spaces is like empty string.

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 strings.
